    "### Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are a type of data structure in Python that is used to store an ordered sequence of elements. The main characteristics of tuples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: The elements in a tuple are ordered, meaning that they have a specific position or index in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Tuples are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified. You can't add, remove or modify elements in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: A tuple can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterable: You can iterate over the elements of a tuple using a loop or other iterable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, tuples are immutable in Python, which means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified. This is different from lists, which are mutable and allow for the addition, removal, and modification of elements. If you need a data structure that allows for modification of its elements, you should use a list instead of a tuple."

    "### Q2. What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two built-in methods for tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "count(): This method returns the number of times a specified element appears in the tuple. The syntax for using this method is tuple.count(element). Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 3)\n",
    "count_3 = my_tuple.count(3)\n",
    "print(count_3) # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "index(): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in the tuple. The syntax for using this method is tuple.index(element). Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape')\n",
    "orange_index = my_tuple.index('orange')\n",
    "print(orange_index) # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why tuples have only two in-built methods compared to lists is because tuples are designed to be immutable. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. Since tuples are immutable, there is no need for methods that modify the contents of a tuple, such as append(), extend(), insert(), and remove(), which are available for lists. The two methods provided for tuples are sufficient for querying the contents of a tuple, which is the primary use case for this data structure.\n"

    "### Q3. Which collection datatypes in python do not allow duplicate items? Write a code using a set to remove duplicates from the given list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the collection datatypes that do not allow duplicate items are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicate items, so any duplicates are automatically removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frozen sets: A frozen set is similar to a set, but it is immutable, meaning that its contents cannot be modified after it is created. Like sets, frozen sets also do not allow duplicate items.\n",

    "### Q4. Explain the difference between the union() and update() methods for a set. Give an example of\n",
    "each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both union() and update() are methods used to combine two sets into a new set. However, there is a subtle difference between the two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The union() method returns a new set that contains all the unique elements from both sets. It does not modify either of the original sets. The syntax for using union() method is set1.union(set2). \n",

    "In this example, we create two sets set1 and set2, and then we use the union() method to create a new set set3 that contains all the unique elements from both set1 and set2.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the update() method modifies the original set by adding all the unique elements from another set to it. The syntax for using update() method is set1.update(set2). Here's an example:\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "set1.update(set2)\n",
