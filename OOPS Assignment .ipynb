    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. Inheritance helps to reduce code duplication, increase code reusability, and improve the overall structure of a program.\n",

    "There are five types of inheritance in object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from a single superclass.\n",
    "Example: A \"Car\" class can inherit from a \"Vehicle\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Multiple inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses.\n",
    "Example: A \"FlyingCar\" class can inherit from both the \"Car\" and \"Plane\" classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Multi-level inheritance: In multi-level inheritance, a subclass inherits from a superclass, which in turn, inherits from another superclass.\n",
    "Example: A \"SportsCar\" class can inherit from the \"Car\" class, which in turn, inherits from the \"Vehicle\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Hierarchical Inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.\n",
    "Example: A \"Sedan\" class, \"SUV\" class, and \"Hatchback\" class can inherit from the \"Car\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Hybrid inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n",
    "Example: A \"ElectricCar\" class can inherit from both \"Car\" and \"Battery\" classes using multiple inheritance, while also inheriting from the \"Vehicle\" class using single inheritance.\n",
