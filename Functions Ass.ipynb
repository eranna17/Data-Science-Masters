    "#### Q4. What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a generator function is a special type of function that generates an iterator. Unlike normal functions, which execute and return a single result at a time, generator functions yield a sequence of values, one at a time, using the yield keyword. The values can be produced on-the-fly, allowing for more efficient use of memory and faster processing of large datasets.\n",

    "    while n < limit:\n",
    "        yield n\n",
    "        n += 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the even_numbers() function generates a sequence of even numbers up to the given limit using the yield keyword. The while loop increments the value of n by 2 on each iteration until it reaches the limit. When the yield keyword is encountered, the current value of n is returned, and the function is paused until the next value is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the generator function, we can create an iterator object and iterate through it using the next() method:\n",
    "my_iter = even_numbers(10)\n",
    "print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 0\n",
    "print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 2\n",

    "print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 6\n",
    "print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create an iterator object my_iter by calling the even_numbers() function with a limit of 10. Then, we use the next() method to iterate through the first five even numbers in the sequence generated by the function, printing each value to the console.
